# Description
Some tiny scripts I have written to extend the functionality of my computer. These are

* search Wikipedia for the highlighted word (i.e. mark a word in pdf document or a news article, then type `<ALT + E>` or `<ALT + E>` to search Wikipedia)
* translate the highlighted word via Linguee (procedure is the same as for search Wikipedia)
