# Description
Here I want to present some extracts of my personal wiki to try to demontrate how I use https://zim-wiki.org/ to organize, preserve and linking any information and reference I find interesting.

Although marked as `md`-files [zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) uses an distinct markdown-like scheme to achive formatting. Hence, the displayed files were exported and may look like inconsistent or faulty in the context of markdown.
