# Description
Here I want to present some extracts of my personal wiki to try to demontrate how I use https://zim-wiki.org/ to organize, preserve and link any information and reference I find interesting.

Some extracts, for instance that on [Linux](./Linux.md), descend into many subpages, to grasp the full extend you can can always navigate into the corresponding folder, i. .e [Linux-files](./Linuxr_files).

# Disclaimer
Although marked as `md`-files, [zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) uses a distinct markdown-like scheme to achive formatting. Hence, the displayed files were exported and may look inconsistent or faulty in the context of markdown.
