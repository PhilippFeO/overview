# Description
Here I want to present some extracts of my personal wiki to try to demontrate how I use https://zim-wiki.org/ to organize, preserve and link any information and reference I find interesting.

# Navigation
Some extracts, for instance that on [Linux](./Linux.md), consist of many subpages. To grasp the full extend you can always navigate into the corresponding folder (in this case [Linux_files](./Linux_files)).

# Disclaimer
Although marked as `md`-files, [zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) uses a distinct markdown-like scheme to achive formatting. Hence, the displayed files were exported and may look inconsistent or faulty in the context of markdown.
