# Abstract â€“ The hippocampus and language: Word to word prediction in terms of the successor representation
The theoretical background of my master thesis is founded on the concept of the places and grid cells of the hippocampus, which control different tasks of orientation. They range from classical spatial navigation in a city or building to abstract mappings between velocity and vehicle based on engine power and mass. These results were already examined by the means of Machine Learning. Thus, this work wants to try to extent the methods to process language in hope to gain some conclusions on place and grid cells. For this purpose, the Successor Representation as application of the Projective Map theory is implemented by deploying a Neural Network under multiple architectures. Furthermore, different techniques of Natural Language Processing are used, because the training data is generated from two books to have plausible language data.
