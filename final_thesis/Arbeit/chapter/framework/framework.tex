\chapter{Framework} \label{ch: framework}
After setting up the theoretical basis for the tools needed to start the experiments, the code framework will be introduced. In general, it is a supervised dense Neural Network written in \python{}~\cite{VanRossumEtAl09Python} with the help of \keras{}~\cite{chollet2015keras} and \numpy{}~\cite{harris2020array}. The process is divided into two phases: One training phase and one for visualization of the results. The goal was being capable to calculate a decent \srmat{} showing visible clusters in the \gls{mds}-plot. To retrieve the \gls{sr}, a Neural Network is trained, whose predictions serve as transition probability matrix $ T $. If not otherwise stated, a discount factor $ \gamma = 0.5 $ is used.

Different scenarios were tested, hence various models were configured having distinct features \eg some work with \onehot{s}, while other use word vectors or made up rules and datasets.
